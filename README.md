# Energy-Production
This project models energy output of a combined-cycle power plant using 9568 hourly records over six years. It predicts energy production (MW) based on temperature, vacuum, pressure, and humidity. Multiple ML models (RF, LightGBM, KNN, SVM, etc.) were evaluated and deployed via Streamlit for real-time use.
